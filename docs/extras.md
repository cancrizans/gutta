# Extra Pages

Extra pages are simply additional standalone pages that exist separately from the webcomic tree structure (they are not nodes). Common uses would include a cast page, and about page, lore, credits and links, etc.

To create an extra page, create a file with `.md` (Markdown) extension inside of the `_source` folder. Then we can wire it all up in `webcomic.yaml` like this:

```yaml
extras:
    about:
        from: about.md
    cast:
        from: cast.md
```

and so on.

## Writing content in markdown

You can write content in markdown, which is very, very easy. If it's just text you need, it's probably gonna work as is with no issues. Basic formatting, like bold, italic, links,headers, etc., are also pretty simple. The syntax is similar to discord messages, and you can find a reference [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

You can see an example of an extra page in `about.md` of your autogenerated template.

I recommend doing as much as you can with plain markdown combined with SCSS styling of the elements that gutta automatically creates. But sometimes you may have more advanced layout needs that would be clunky or impossible in markdown. In that case, you can actually simply inline HTML snippets within the markdown.

## Context variables and including images

To include an image in markdown, you would need to do something like this

```markdown
![](https://site.com/url-to-image.jpeg)
```

but how to include our own image from the assets folder? You can use the `{{variable}}` notation to mark where gutta should substitute a value from the context associated with this particular page. So for example, using the variable for the relative location of the assets folder:

```markdown
![]({{assets}}catpics/cat001.png)
```

Here are the currently available context variables in extra pages:

| Pattern | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `{{sroot}}` | Relative location of site root |
| `{{assets}}` | Relative location of assets folder |
| `{{title}}` | Title of extra page (the key in `extras:`, not the filename) |
